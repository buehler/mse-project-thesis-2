# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

"Distributed Authentication Mesh" [@buehler:DistAuthMesh] introduces a theoretical foundation for dynamic authorization in heterogeneous systems. The project, in conjunction with the provided Proof of Concept (PoC) showed, that it is generally possible to transform the identity of a user such that the user can be authorized in another application. In contrast to SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), the authentication mesh does not require all participants to understand the same authentication and authorization mechanisms. Thus, the mesh is designed to work within a heterogeneous authentication landscape.

The PoC was designed to show the ability of heterogeneous authentication. {@fig:01_poc} shows two applications that were communicating with each other. The source application supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) and the "API" application only supports HTTP Basic authentication. The applications were able to communicate with each other despite the fact, that they do not share the same authentication mechanism. An Envoy proxy enabled the dynamic modification of the HTTP headers. Thus, the PoC did modify the HTTP headers in-flight and replaced the OIDC access token with HTTP Basic credentials.

The project "Distributed Authentication Mesh" mentioned a "common language format" for the transport, but did not define nor implement it [@buehler:DistAuthMesh]. This project enhances the concept of the "Distributed Authentication Mesh" by evaluating and specifying the transport protocol for the common language between services. With this contribution, it will be possible to implement the authentication mesh on a target platform, since the common language is crucial for the success of the mesh. To complement the concept, this work contains an open-source implementation of the mesh for Kubernetes^[<https://kubernetes.io/>]. The implementation is tied to Kubernetes itself, but the concept of the mesh can be adapted to various platforms like Desktop applications.

The remainder of the report describes prerequisites, used technologies with their terminology and further concepts. {@sec:state_of_the_art}, "State of the Authentication Mesh", shows the current version of the concept and which elements are missing. The implementation section shows the concrete evaluation of the common language format combined with the definition and application of the chosen format. Since the implemented version of the mesh runs on Kubernetes, an Operator is created during the implementation to automate the usage of the authentication mesh to allow a good developer experience. The conclusion provides an overview of the results of this work and further gives an outlook for follow-up projects.
