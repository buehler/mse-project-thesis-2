With the introduction of the concept "Distributed Authentication Mesh" [@buehler:DistAuthMesh], a theoretical base for dynamic authorization was created. The project, in conjunction with the Proof of Concept (PoC) showed, that it is generally possible to transform the identity of a user to another application. This transmitted identity can authenticate the user in a trusted system. In contrast to SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) the authentication mesh does not require all parties to understand the same authentication and authorization mechanism. The mesh is designed to work within a heterogeneous authentication landscape.

This project enhances the concept of the "Distributed Authentication Mesh" by evaluating and specifying the transport protocol for the common language between services. The common language is crucial for the success of a

The remainder of the report describes prerequisites, used technologies and further concepts.
