# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

With the introduction of the concept "Distributed Authentication Mesh" [@buehler:DistAuthMesh], a theoretical base for dynamic authorization was created. The project, in conjunction with the Proof of Concept (PoC) showed, that it is generally possible to transform the identity of a user to another application. This transmitted identity can authenticate the user in a trusted system.

This project enhances the concept of the "Distributed Authentication Mesh" by specifying the transport protocol for the common language between services.

The remainder of the report describes prerequisites, used technologies and further concepts.
