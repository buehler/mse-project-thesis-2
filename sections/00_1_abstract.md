# Abstract

A central part of the "Distributed Authentication Mesh" in [@buehler:DistAuthMesh] is the "common language format". This format is eminently important to the mesh because it delivers the users' ID. While the work included the concept of the mesh and implemented a Proof of Concept for the modification of HTTP headers, it did not provide a definition for the common language format.

This project targets this issue and analyzes several possibilities for such a format and defines the objects that must be transmitted for the mesh. The concept of the mesh is extended with a "Rule Engine" that improves the security and versatility of the mesh. Additionally, this project implements the "Distributed Authentication Mesh" as open-source software such that it can be operated on Kubernetes. The conclusion provides further information about the project and possible topics of follow-up projects.
